Today, the 27th of April 2022, marks my very first day on my PhD journey. I am *scared, excited, and grateful*, all at the same time (.❛ ᴗ ❛.).
I am scared of adversity ahead. Excited about incoming projects and discussions. Grateful for this short time on Earth.
Nevertheless, it's still a casual day, I went to work at 8:45AM, had lunch around 12:30PM. My dog pee inside the house, and my cat was sick.

At work, I decided to jot down my PhD bucket list here. Both academic and non-academic related. It's gonna be about my 5-beautiful-year as a Badger. Oh, Wisconsin!
